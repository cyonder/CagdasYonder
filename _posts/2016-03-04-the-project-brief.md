    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparing the project brief is an essential step that initiates the design process.
      As the preparatory stage, the brief provides a meticulous overview of the project,
      while informing all parties involved in the development and production of the design.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project brief addresses the design in detail and includes every aspect
      of the problem, as well as the roles of the client, designer and viewer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is used throughout the process as a reference tool to ensure that the
      design reflects the project objectives, moves in the proper direction, and
      relates to the needs of the client and viewer. Design must be calculated and
      meaningful and should reflect its function with a high degree of communicative
      and aesthetic proficiency.
