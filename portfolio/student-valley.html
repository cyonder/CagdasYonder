        During my education in college I was frustrated with use of Blackboard,
        which is a "Learning Management System" that is used by many colleges
        and universities all around the world. This system provides a platform for
        students to sell their old books, message other students, ask questions and
        many other features like this. But because of its very bad design only a
        few students were using it.

        Eventually, I decided to start a project as an alternative to Blackboard.

        I believe that essential to design is the ability to communicate and publish.
        Part of the mission of Student Valley is for everyone to become a publisher.
        This site is created to encourage communication, sharing, helping, and publishing.

      This project is currently under development, and is expected to be launched
      late 2016. I have built this website with two versions using PHP and Ruby on Rails.
      Figure 1 and 3 represents PHP version, which is no longer in development.
      Figure 2 and 4 represents Ruby on Rails version that is currently under development.

        I have worked hard to consolidate the menu options and simplify them. Also,
        notice that the left sidebar, is moved into header resulting in more simply
        achieved user goals. Also, a focus on space and rythmn led users to better
        understand what to do next in their workflow.
