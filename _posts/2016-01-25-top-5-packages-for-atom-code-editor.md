<a href='https://atom.io' target='blank'>Atom</a> is a code editor made by GitHub. It is extremely hackable, yet still user-friendly. Atom comes with a few
<a href='https://atom.io/users/atom' target='blank'>official built-in packages</a>, such as tree-view and image-view. Above all, Atom is free to use.

In this post, I will be writing about my favourite 5 packages.

<div class='spacer'></div>

##### 1. Pigments
<a href='https://atom.io/packages/pigments' target='blank'>Pigments</a> is a package to display colors in your files.

It also has support for Sass, and LESS files. So, if you use Sass mixins, such as lighten() or darken(), Pigments will show the result of that mixin.

##### 2. Color Picker
<a href='https://atom.io/packages/emmet' target='blank'>Color Picker</a> package, as the name implies, lets you pick colors for your websites. Also, it has the ability to convert between color formats.

To use color picker, you either need to right click on a color and select 'Color Picker', or place the cursor on a color and hit <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> on Mac, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> on Windows.

##### 3. Highlight Selected
<a href='https://atom.io/packages/highlight-selected' target='blank'>Highlight Selected</a> marks all instances of a word within the current file. To use it, just double click on a word to select and it will highlight all instances of the word.

Also, there is another package with the name <a href='https://atom.io/packages/minimap-highlight-selected' target='blank'>Minimap Highlight Selected</a>, it's a Minimap binding for Highlight Selected.

##### 4. Minimap
<a href='https://atom.io/packages/minimap' target='blank'>Minimap</a> is one of Atom's most most popular packages. If you have ever used
<a href='https://www.sublimetext.com' target='blank'>Sublime Text</a>, you have
probably worked with its minimap. So, with this minimap package, you will have the same
feature for Atom.

##### 5. Emmet
<a href='https://atom.io/packages/emmet' target='blank'>Emmet</a> is a must-have package for all developers. It lets you write HTML and CSS abbreviations without having to write regular syntax.

There is a <a href='http://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet' target='blank'>Cheat Sheet</a> that will help you to learn Emmet's abbreviations.
